# Hotel-Management-System

I have created a desktop application in hotel management system using Tkinter library in python and mysql as a database and have given 100% to it to made it better and dynamic.

Through this project I was able to enhance my knowledge in python mand mysql.

Also I have added pictures on backround thumbnails to make it look attractive and nice.


Desktop aplications are not hosted there are just shared with the organisation and is run on a computer.

For running my project on your pc you just have to clone my repository then import database in your xampp using hotelmgmtdb.sql file and then in pycharm create your own environment and run HotelManager.py file and tadaa!!! your application runs successfully.........
